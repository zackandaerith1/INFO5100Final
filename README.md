Deliverables
1) A running swing application that addresses the challenges outlined above 
at an eco-system scale. A typical implementation must include the 
participation of 4 enterprises, 8 organizations, and 10 roles. 
2) A presentation that outlines details specific to the design and 
implementation of your solution. This must include, the definition of the 
problem you solved, players and their contributions, use-cases, design, and 
implementation techniques followed. You must explain why each 
enterprise is essential to delivering the total value as outlined in your 
problem statement. 
3) A robust role-based authentication module with strong username and 
password capabilities. 
4) A reporting module with summarized view of the data in your system. This 
could include performance data that is important at the system or network 
level.
5) A configuration module with test cases that will populate your model and 
show the correctness of your solution. You might want to integration the 
Faker module from faker.com for random data generation.
